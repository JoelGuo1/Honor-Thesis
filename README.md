# Abstract
Cognitive Diagnostic Models (CDMs) aim to provide information about the degree to which individuals have mastered specific attributes that underlie the success of these individuals on test items. A common component of CDMs for specifying the attributes required for each item is the Q-matrix. Although construction of Q-matrix is typically performed by domain experts, it nonetheless, to a large extent, remains a subjective process, and misspecifications in the Q-matrix, if left unchecked, can have important practical implications. To address this concern, this paper uses an assumption-free model: spectral clustering, as a validation benchmark to detect if the Q-matrix is misspecied, subject to a common CDM frameworks: non-compensatory deterministic input noisy-and-gate (DINA). The paper then proposes an empirical way to determine the amount of misspecifications in Q-matrices. In doing so, the data TIMSS 2011 Mathematics 4th Grade Austrian Students from R CDM package is used as validation, and the empirical cut-off is found. Results also show that attribute specifications can differ from expert opinions and the underlying model for each item can vary. In addition, the model's performance under different amounts of Q-matrix
misspecifications has been studied and it shows that DINA model has certain tolerance to maintain its high-quality performance under small amount of misspecification. Lastly, the paper explores other factors contributing to the model such as slip and guess rate.
